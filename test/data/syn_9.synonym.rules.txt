# where:
# LHS : space-delimited words to match in the original reference text
# RHS : semi-colon-delimited list of space-delimited words to consider as equivalent expressions to the LHS

# This is non-recursive and single-pass only.
# By default, there won't be an automatic symetry:
# if you want a-> and b->a, you need to specify both
#
# Empty lines or lines starting with '#' are ignored
